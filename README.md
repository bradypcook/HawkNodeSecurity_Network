# Overview

I created a Campus Area Network (CAN) for a hypothetical company (HawkNode Security), where I implemented typical industry practices while designing and configuring the network.

I wanted to do this project to demonstrate my ability to set up and configure enterprise networks practically.



# Upcoming Features

Here's what's coming in the future (Phase 2):

-Improved addressing between router links (/31)
-Access Control Lists
-ASA Firewall Devices
-NAT (Network Address
-Restructured branches
-Port Security
-Email Network
-FTP instead of TFTP
-Interface Descriptions
-and more (Date TBD)!!

# Documentation

Currently, I have a Google Doc set up with the necessary documentation & addressing information. In the future, I hope to be able to move it to GitHub, but for now, you can view it at the link below:
